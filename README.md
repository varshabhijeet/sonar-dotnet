SonarC# and SonarVB are [static code analyzers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_program_analysis) for the C# and VB.&#8203;NET
languages and are part of the [SonarQube](http://www.sonarqube.org/), [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io) and [SonarLint](https://www.sonarlint.org/) code quality and security products. These analyzers allow you to produce safe, reliable and maintainable code by helping you find and correct bugs, vulnerabilities and code smells in your codebase.

## Features

* 380+ C# rules and 130+ VB.&#8203;NET rules
* Metrics (complexity, duplications, number of lines etc.)
* Import of [unit test results](https://docs.sonarqube.org/x/CoBh) from VSTest, NUnit and xUnit
* Import of [test coverage reports](https://docs.sonarqube.org/x/CoBh) from Visual Studio Code Coverage, dotCover, OpenCover and NCover 3.
* Spport for [custom rules](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonarqube-roslyn-sdk)

## How to contribute

There are many ways you can contribute to the `sonar-dotnet` project. 
When contributing, please respect our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

### Join the discussions

One of the easiest ways to contribute is to share your feedback with us (see [give feedback](#do-you-have-a-question-or-feedback)) and also answer questions from [our community forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/).
You can also monitor the activity on this repository (opened issues, opened PRs) to get more acquainted with what we do.

### Pull Request (PR)

If you want to fix [an issue](https://github.com/SonarSource/sonar-dotnet/issues),
please read the [Get started](#get-started) pages first and make sure that you follow [our coding style](./docs/coding-style.md).

Before submitting the PR, make sure [all tests](./docs/contributing-analyzer.md#running-tests) are passing (all checks must be green).

* We suggest you do not pick issues with the `Area: CFG` label
_(they are difficult, can have many side effects and are less likely to be accepted)_.
* We suggest you do not implement new rules unless they are already specified for C# and/or VB.NET on
our [rules repository](https://jira.sonarsource.com/projects/RSPEC).

Note: our CI runs only on PRs opened by sonarsourcers.
After your PR is ready, we will cherry-pick your commits and open a PR to run the CI (keeping the attribution).

## Custom Rules

To request new rules, Contact us on [our Community Forum](https://community.sonarsource.com/c/suggestions/).

If you have an idea for a rule but you are not sure that everyone needs it, you can implement your own Roslyn analyzer.
- You can start with [this tutorial from Microsoft](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/roslyn-sdk/tutorials/how-to-write-csharp-analyzer-code-fix) to write an analyzer.
- All Roslyn-based issues are picked up by the [Scanner for MSBuild](https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-msbuild/)
and pushed to SonarQube / SonarCloud as external issues.
- Also check out [SonarQube Roslyn SDK](https://github.com/SonarSource-VisualStudio/sonarqube-roslyn-sdk) to embed
your Roslyn analyzer in a SonarQube plugin, if you want to manage your rules from SonarQube.
